I am currently senior, expected to graduate from NJIT in December 2014 with a major in&nbsp; Management Information systems. Here are a few things about me. I was born in Parsippany, New jersey until I was around the ripe old age of 8 where I then moved to Boonton, New jersey and have lived here ever since.&nbsp; My hobbies include snowboarding during the winter, playing soccer and volleyball and I also love to draw, everyone has a creative side. My future expectations for myself is to receive my masters in 4 years time in Pharmaceutical management and move on from there. &lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;/Body&gt;</p><p>&lt;/html&gt;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
